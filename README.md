Welcome to my portfolio website!

 Please note that the website is best viewed on a laptop or desktop in a full-screen window.
 
 To continue, this portfolio reflects who I am and my unique style. I've poured a lot of effort into it. I hope you enjoy browsing through it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
 
 I've incorporated many interactive elements throughout the site. Including buttons and links. For example, my logo and the arrow on the landing page are clickable! Make sure to check it all out.
 
 In addition to meeting the project requirements, I've challenged myself to go further with HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional website. I've also paid attention to aesthetic design, and user experience to ensure that everything is not only pleasing to the eye but also easy to navigate and interact with.
 
 I've cited the pages where I adapted or copied code from within the project, and here's a list of other resources I frequently visited during the development process and the citations for Images that are not mine:
