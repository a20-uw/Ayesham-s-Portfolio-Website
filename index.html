        <h1>Oh,</h1>
        <h2>HI THERE!</h2>
        <p>As you already may know my name is Ayesham Raheel. I’m a third-year Global Business and Digital Arts student at the University of Waterloo, Stratford School of Interaction Design and business. Ever since my childhood, I've been captivated by the world of creativity, aesthetics and self-expression. Whether it be shown through my fashion style, my words or my work. It's this lifelong passion that fuels my journey as a freelance digital artist and photographer. I've poured my heart into this portfolio, and I invite you to explore and immerse yourself in my work. Let's create something extraordinary — I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
